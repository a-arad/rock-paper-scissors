# rock-paper-scissors: Project Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
A simple Rock Paper Scissors game web application

## Architecture
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Express
- Database: None
- Deployment: Vercel

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow the language-specific best practices
- Write comprehensive tests for new features
- Ensure all functions have clear documentation
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Development Workflow
**CRITICAL: All implementations must follow this exact workflow:**

1. **Create a feature branch** from main using descriptive names (e.g., `feature/setup-frontend`, `feature/game-logic`)
2. **Implement features with comprehensive tests** on the feature branch
3. **Commit frequently** with clear, descriptive commit messages
4. **Create a pull request** using `gh pr create` when implementation is complete
5. **Include comprehensive PR description** with summary, features, and test results
6. **Merge only after CI passes** and review is complete

### span Integration - REQUIRED WORKFLOW
This project is managed by span, an AI-powered development orchestrator.

**ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Every task MUST end with a pull request creation**

- **Task coordination** happens via GitHub Actions
- **Implementation guidance** is provided in module-specific CLAUDE.md files  
- **Progress tracking** occurs through GitHub issues and pull requests
- **ALL CODE CHANGES** must be committed to a feature branch and submitted as a PR
- **NO DIRECT COMMITS TO MAIN** - always work on feature branches
- **ALWAYS USE** `gh pr create` to submit your implementation

## Next Steps
1. Set up development environment
2. Implement core features in phases
3. Add comprehensive testing
4. Deploy to production
